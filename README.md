# Deep learning framework for image segmentation -- Unet, using Keras

## Overview
Data
The original dataset is from isbi challenge, and I've downloaded it and done the pre-processing.

You can find it in folder data/membrane.

Data augmentation
The data for training contains 17 100*100 images

This deep neural network is implemented with Keras functional API, which makes it extremely easy to experiment with different interesting architectures.
